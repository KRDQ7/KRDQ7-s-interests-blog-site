            <h2>RPGs</h2>
            <p>The bulk of what I enjoy seems to be RPGs these days. (RPG is short for Role-Playing Game in case you did not know.) I enjoy this genre mainly because despite how simple the gameplay can be to someone besides myself, I know that the games I play tell very elaborate stories with this format. Examples of a few are classics such as Earthbound by Nintendo and indie hits such as Undertale.</p>
            <h3>More on Earthbound</h3>
            <p>Earthbound may not change the RPG formula too much besides something often referred to as rolling health, but it is a good game. The rolling health is a system where even if a hit should have defeated your party members, as long as you can heal before the hp rolls down to 0, you can recover from the damage. It essentially adds some reaction time and prompting to be aware of various circumstances as you play. The game also tells a rather whimsical story with moments and dialogue that most describe as being very quirky in nature. Earthbound is usually regarded as an hidden gem of a classic because of the fact that it is a SNES game that went relatively under the radar upon release due to other games at the time such as Chrono Trigger. The inclusion of the game's protagonist Ness in the other Nintendo IP Super Smash Bros. got people to learn about the game some time after launch and rekindled a love for the game.</p>
            <h3>More on Undertale</h3>
            <p>Undertale changes the RPG formula mainly due to its combat system in which you are able to dodge oncoming enemy attacks in the form of multiple "bullet" patterns. Furthermore, the game has a a different approach to gameplay with the player being encouraged to be a pacifist towards every enemy as opposed to fighting every enemy. This pacifist system is acted at by the player being encouraged to do various "ACTS" towards enemies to befriend them and then spare them. With every enemy in the game the pattern of attack varies and the means to pacify varies. This game is also rather silly at times with quirky writing but can get very serious at times.</p>
